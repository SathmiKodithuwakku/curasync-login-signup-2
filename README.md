# Simplified File Operations Guide

This is a beginner-friendly version of the file handling system that focuses on basic file operations with clear explanations and simple implementation.

## Components Overview

### 1. FileUpload
- Handles file selection and validation
- Checks file type and size
- Shows clear error messages
- Easy to customize allowed file types and size limits

### 2. DocumentViewer
- Displays uploaded files
- Supports different file types (images, PDFs, text)
- Shows file information
- Handles file preview

### 3. FileList
- Shows list of uploaded files
- Basic file operations (download, delete)
- Clear and simple interface
- File size formatting

### 4. File Helper Utilities
- Common file operations
- Size formatting
- Type checking
- File reading functions

## How to Use

1. File Upload:
```jsx
<FileUpload
  label="Upload Document"
  allowedTypes={['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf']}
  maxSizeInMB={5}
  onFileSelect={(file) => console.log('File selected:', file)}
/>
```

2. Document Viewer:
```jsx
<DocumentViewer
  file={selectedFile}
  fileType="image"
/>
```

3. File List:
```jsx
<FileList
  files={uploadedFiles}
  onDelete={(index) => handleFileDelete(index)}
  onDownload={(file) => handleFileDownload(file)}
/>
```

4. Using File Helpers:
```typescript
import { fileHelpers } from '../utils/fileHelpers';

// Format file size
const size = fileHelpers.formatFileSize(1024); // "1.00 KB"

// Check file type
const isAllowed = fileHelpers.isAllowedFileType(file, ['image/jpeg']);

// Read text file
const content = await fileHelpers.readTextFile(textFile);
```

## Features

- Simple and clear code structure
- Helpful comments explaining each part
- Basic error handling
- Responsive design
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Reusable components
- Easy to extend and modify

## Best Practices

1. Always validate files before upload
2. Show clear error messages
3. Clean up file URLs when no longer needed
4. Handle different file types appropriately
5. Use proper error handling
6. Implement loading states
7. Provide feedback for user actions

## File Handling Process

1. File Selection:
   - User selects a file
   - System validates file type and size
   - Shows error if validation fails

2. File Preview:
   - Creates temporary URL for preview
   - Displays appropriate viewer based on file type
   - Shows file information

3. File Management:
   - List of uploaded files
   - Basic operations (download, delete)
   - File information display

4. File Operations:
   - Helper functions for common tasks
   - Error handling
   - Clean up resources

## Security Considerations

1. Always validate file types
2. Limit file sizes
3. Clean up temporary URLs
4. Sanitize file names
5. Handle errors gracefully
